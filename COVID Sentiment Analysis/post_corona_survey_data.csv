Not only just because I see that the school isn‰Ûªt doing much for us who don‰Ûªt live in relaxed or fortunate lifestyles. I personally don‰Ûªt feel motivated to be attending ANY class because I have so many non school related issues happening but I know it is simply my duty to go through with it if not I will suffer consequences in the form of academic delay. I don‰Ûªt talk to any other students unless I must because my priorities are keeping my family safe and help them get through our current situation such as baby sitting as people in my household go to work. I feel my life is much different from classmates and even fear and get anxious when having to meet with them. ,Graduation and job market,It‰Ûªs caused a lot of anxiety and uncertainty. From looking at other and hearing from others in class it seems (at least to me and I could be mistaken) that many are doing fine but I feel like I can‰Ûªt keep up.,Zoom is great. It helps me attend lectures and it has great features to facilitate learning. ,"Pandemic has really brought me back to my family. Spending time away from them while in college allows me to separate from issues at home and solely focus on school. Although it is tougher being at home, I know that they are my priority. School is only temporary, they are not. ",The pandemic has made me think about myself and what it is I want out of where I am in college. Especially managing where my interests are. Living with small children in my house has also made me become a temporary teacher which focuses a lot on what I have learned in my minor. I know that Stats is my major but I most definitely do not want to be a consultant. I want to focus on research within autism and in early childhood development. Being home with the children makes me realize that what I want to do not only could impact them but many others as well.

2020/04/19 11:49:06 PM MDT,STEM,No,In my apartment,No,Less motivated than before?,2,2,"I have felt less a part of UCLA during the pandemic, but I have also seen tremendous effort by student clubs and other organizations to make virtual events for people to still interact. I don't feel as a part of UCLA because I am not interacting in the classroom environment, like being physically in the same room as the instructor and other students. I have especially felt this about office hours, because I can't just sit next to my instuctor and ask them questions about the material. There is a big difference between in-person and virtual interaction. Not interacting with more people a day makes it more difficult for me to get out of my own head sometimes. Many organizations, though, have made effrots to create virtual events for people to feel a sense of belonging during this time. For example, I am a part of Stats Club executive board and we are still hosting events fro studnets to interact with eachother and faculty virutally. I think that has been meaningful and helpful to many. ALso, it is nice, however, not having to run around campus all day and lug everything that I need for the day on my back.

I consider family and health much more important now. I used to call my grandparents once every 2-3 months, but I have been calling about once every 2 weeks. I think this is a really nice change and it's one I've been wanting to make for a while even before the pandemic started. It's nice both for me and for my grandparents - they enjoy it as well. Moreover, the pandemic has forced me to think about how I always have a go-go-go attitude and that slowing down a bit might actually be good for my personal health. Since all of the events were forced to not occur anymore, there are limited options of what to do and, in turn, my life has slowed down a bit. I sleep more hours every night, I eat more full means, and I spend more time relaxing & reflecting on my own life. This seems to actually be really good for my life, especially sleeping more.

But as a result of this pandemic and leaving school earlier I feel challenge not being able to connect with my professors and peers as I use to. I rather learn face to face because of the hands on experience I have my classmates and professor but as a result of being isolated from them I feel as I have to learn everything myself. ,I feel as though I am not going to efficiently learn anything this quarter because of the limited interaction with my peers and other resources that the campus offer me that is not available during this time. ,"I don't learn the same way as I use to. Since I used to live at the dorm room and I had access to multiple lounges and libraries whenever and whatever time. However, because I moved back home, it's hard to concentrate and to do work. It's to loud and I have responsibilities to carry out everyday so I don't focus as much as I use to. ",I feel as zoom has lowered my academic life because as I stated before it limits any type of face to face interaction I have with my professor and my peers. It also limits having a suitable place to study.,"Although the pandemic has limited me and others around the world social interaction and many other things, I view this quarantine as a good time to reflect upon ourselves and the world. I have found time to reflect upon what actions I should take to help my community out and how I am able to do that. ","Since I live far away from UCLA I don't have a chance to go home every other weekend like many of my peers do or go home at all until the breaks because of the expensive tickets but because of this pandemic I can spend more time with my family. I have a younger sibling that I never see much because of school and two older siblings that I also never see much because they are in college too but because of this epidemic I am able to have some family bonding time with them, something I wan't able to have before.

I know the time and Zoom environment doesn‰Ûªt quite accommodate that, and it‰Ûªs certainly not essential, but it‰Ûªs still highly desirable. I appreciate the times my Stats professor starts conversations with us and those who choose to respond use the chat to communicate as a class. I have just begun to acclimate to the situation and other factors (emotional/mental challenges, unfamiliarity and difficulty in regaining the ‰ÛÏschool‰Û mentality) have all mostly diminished. ",I don‰Ûªt have many concerns as I‰Ûªm trying to be optimistic in thinking of the future.

It is certainly not an equal substitute to the academic and social life I am used to. However, it in no way is above public health, and I find that my extremely fortunate circumstances put me in a position to focus on gratitude for the situation rather than wishing it were back to normal. ","I have experienced a huge period of self-growth and learning how to exist as an individual and without social pressures. I think my confidence has increased, and I find myself more willing to take chances, rather than always being afraid of what others may think of me. The pandemic has taught me not to take my time with people for granted and that my relationships are important and should be treated us such. ","Most of my positive effects have been mentioned in the previous question. I‰Ûªve also found more time for my hobbies and personal care (working out, skincare, yoga) that I wouldn‰Ûªt have otherwise.

As a first gen transfer student, UCLA has gave me a lot of opportunities and resources that are available only on campus. It‰Ûªs difficult to access and navigate those resources and seek help and motivate during remote learning. Many of us first gen students here at UCLA are low income and don‰Ûªt have all of the technological resources or familial support that other students may have. ","I‰Ûªm not sure, I just want to be able to learn in person, I can‰Ûªt learn virtually.

We‰Ûªre in this on our own and it‰Ûªs difficult trying to scrape by while maintaining our academic integrity to succeed.  "
2020/04/23 1:41:20 AM MDT,STEM,No,In US but outside CA,No,Equally motivated,2,1,"Despite being home and not on UCLA's campus, I still feel pretty connected to UCLA. Most of my teachers have been very understanding and accommodating and events my sorority has put on virtually have helped me stay connected. Other clubs and organizations on campus have done a great job trying their best to help me and my fellow classmates feel connected as well. From guest seminars and online workout classes, I feel as if I am still a part of UCLA's community even off of campus. That being said, I am a very social individual and I find it difficult to complete school work at home. Without my group of friends, classmates, and other peers around campus it is very difficult to feel motivated and driven like I am when around them. When I am sad or having a rough time with with my academics, it is difficult to not have a major support system of my friends right around the corner.  ","I am concerned about not getting to go back and participate in the same activities the same way when we are back on campus. I am also worried that something like this could start again. This concerns me quite a bit because if something like this were to happen again, I am not sure I could afford to continue going to UCLA. My parents own their own business and they help me pay for my school. Due to the coronavirus they were forced to close their doors for weeks costing them and their business greatly. If there were to be another outbreak forcing them to close, it could mean that I don't have the funds to continuing attending UCLA.","It has only increased it. I feel like by doing distance learning I have put so much pressure on myself to perform like I normally would on campus and as if everything was normal. This is almost an unfair expectation I put on myself due to all of the uncertainty and unusual circumstances. Although I am aware of this and online learning is more difficult for me I can't seem to relieve too much of that anxiety. As a freshman, I feel like I was just starting to get the hang of academics at UCLA and on a college level. This pandemic has put a spin on things and been quite tough to adjust to personally.","By utilizing zoom, I have been able to complete my schoolwork virtually as well as various other activities with friends and family. For instance, my family held a zoom passover and my friends had a virtual birthday celebration. ","It has made me realize how broken and divided our country and political system is. I feel like a majority of this pandemic has not always been about the health of our citizens, but instead a game of politics. This is an unsettling thing to think about because our future and the outcomes of this pandemic all lie in the hands of individuals who are more worried about the upcoming election and making political statements rather than getting the equipment and resources needed to battle this pandemic properly. I hope that as Americans we realize this and grow. We need to learn from the current situations and put measures in place to prevent and prepare for future circumstances.","I have really enjoyed getting to spend some extra time with my family. My sister goes off to college next year so by getting to come home I have been able to bond with her and make so many new memories. Even in the midst of the crazy and scary situations surrounding us currently, I am grateful to get to do random things with her like bake banana bread and paint rocks. On the positive side of spending the spring quarter at home, these are moments her and I would never have had without the pandemic."

Online classes are extremely difficult and not as engaging. I also worry about how other people are doing. Where people will he left financially and how the world is going to change. Which I hope is positive and becomes less consumer and capitalist in nature and the powers of the country are decentralize and the people can take back our power and reimagine and reshape the world how we want it. ,I feel a heightened sense of anxiety but a lack of ability to produce and succeed. I feel like academics are something really difficult to focus on or feel like there is a point however I also realize I am still in school and lucky to have access to education. This push and pull causes more anxiety on top of an already anxious and stressful time ,Yes of course. I don‰Ûªt see anyone but my parents in person. Zoom has definitely helped lower the amount of human contact.  ,"Not in many ways, I think it gives me a stronger argument for things I have previously believed and to be the most important. However it has made me confront my going to school and feelings of discontentment with school in general. I am trying to gather the courage to ask if I can take off a year and do something else. It has not changed my philosophies of life just made them stronger and made me feel like living a life which I think is amazing and wonderful and worth it needs to happen sooner than I thought. The urgency for happiness and joy is more present. To create my own path to not follow and do what I am expected to make someone else happy. I have to start acting in ways which truly make me happy and listen to myself and my feelings more. There is no more time to put things off and get to it later. I feel more urgent maybe that is the change but my philosophies and beliefs are  relatively the same. ",Well like I shared earlier specifically for math coming from a totally non math background I have felt like this class is way more accessible for me. I‰Ûªm not sure what it would be like in person but having this statistics 10 class be online I think has helped me feel much more comfortable in the class and like it is easier for me to speak up and ask questions where other math classes I‰Ûªve taken I have felt really stupid and like I could not ask questions. Also I think the pandemic has been although a really difficult time of reflection a very important one. A very important and hopefully good time of growth and realizations about myself and who I am and who I want to be.

I have realized how much I appreciate my in-person lectures, and the interactions that I experienced on a daily basis with students, TAs, professors, and UCLA employees on a daily basis. Right now, however, I feel like I could be a student at any random university, as I do not get to learn from my professors in an organic, natural way. ","In terms of academics, I am concerned that it will continue longer than just spring and summer quarters, and I will not be able to interact with my professors for some of my favorite courses that I have coming up. Excluding academics, I am worried about getting internships and jobs post-graduation, as the economy is being severely affected by the pandemic. ","I feel like I am not getting the full experience of learning in my courses. Especially since I am a STEM major and have lab courses, those type of courses are really unable to be completed on an online platform, and I am disappointed and anxious that I will not have some of the vital and necessary tools in my field due to not being able to participate as thoroughly in the online setting in these types of courses.","Zoom has not really helped to lower the effect of social distancing in my academic and social life. I feel like it is a strange enviornment for everyone, including professors, however with some professors they make it a much more natural and relaxed environement, especially for my Stats10 lecture and for my EEB100 lecture, because they make their lectures personable and show more of their personality, which is nice. However, for me lectures are also a lot about intereacting with your peers and fellow classmates, and there is no way that Zoom can really amend this, as breakout rooms can still be very awkward. It is better than nothing, though.","Surprisingly I am not as affected on the social side of things, which I believe is in part due to the fact that I am staying with my sister and her husband, who are closer in age to me which might play a factor in this. However this pandemic has affected my philosophy of life in that I think I have become more cynical. Especially in regards to climate change and the effects of global warming, I truly believe that these types of mass hysteria, culture-altering events will become more common in this century due to climate change. I have developed a shift in my mind set, in that I am ultimately planning for another disaster. It makes me sad to my core. I feel like I am not so much as upset about this specific coronavirus pandemic, as I am for our species, and our world as a whole. I think I just fear so much death and poverty in the future as climate change begins taking effect. It is kind of depressing, but it is not something I dwell on every minute of the day, but if I do take time to reflect that is one of my takeaways from this pandemic, sadly.","I have been able to exercise daily and eat much better, which are two huge positives. I am staying with my sister and husband's home, and because of this have gotten much closer to the both of them, which is very special to me as it is something that will last for my whole life. I also am learning to cook much better through the guidance of my sister which is also another positive."

Additionally professors are taking the time to post most material online.

Even though I know that what the news publishes likely does not resemble the whole of people. Money runs everything here, and people seem to think that it'll buy you happiness over literally anything else, despite what they preach will yield you happiness. Also now that I look this over that mental health doesn't mean shit to Americans despite efforts to improve it. My entire generation (Gen-Z, Zoomers, whatever we're called) is collectively built on the rise of social media and making our voices heard.

There are too many depression and self-deprecating humor memes for that to not actually be the source of our issues. An entire generation of people has zero mental health and tolerance for this bullshit life that we're forced into and hopelessness is at an all-time high.

Not being able to live on campus, see peers face to face, meet new people, join clubs, and attend social events, I feel very disconnected from UCLA as a whole. That being said I do feel that my classmates and I have made an effort to community through groupme and group texts way more than before, whether that be for support with class material or just to socialize.","I'm mostly concerned about not knowing what the future will look like in terms of how classes will be offered, how available jobs and internships will be, and how hard it will be to meet new people and have new experiences. I'm currently a freshman so I haven't spent a ton of time at UCLA and I was very upset to have to leave right when I truly felt settled in. I don't like not knowing how long it will be before I can go back to campus. Fortunately, none of my family have been affected by the disease and my parents are lucky enough to be able to work from home so that is a great stress reliever. ","Truthfully, the lack in motivation I've experienced is probably the biggest risk to my academic success. I've never had to do remote learning before and I'm also someone who works best when on a schedule so the switch to online classes has been quite the adjustment. Additionally, the lack of face to face contact in classes makes it harder to form study groups or work group projects or even ask my professors questions.","Academically, I think zoom has been useful especially with the screen sharing and groupchat functions. However, I don't feel that zoom has done much to lower the effect of social distancing on my social life since only one of my discussion sections uses it in a way where we can interact with our peers. ","Being a 19 year-old the most important things to me were my education, my social life, my health and my family. All of these either have or could potentially be compromised due to this pandemic, which is scary to think about. Now, the virus hasn't directly affected my family or friends (thankfully) so I often find myself mostly dwelling on all the opportunities and milestones I'm missing out on since my college experience has been put on pause.

As a peer counselor and someone who works in basic needs, I feel that my efforts would be much more useful going towards helping those in need, instead of myself.

2020/04/25 8:28:08 PM MDT,STEM,No,At home in californa,Yes,Less motivated than before?,2,1,"I feel much more distant from the UCLA community. Since everyone is at home now, it would make sense that we all have time to communicate more with each other, but it has actually felt like the opposite. It has actually become more difficult to plan a time to talk on the phone or any other method because our schedules seem much less compatible now. I feel very anxious about school and if my friends at UCLA and I do have time to text about how school is going, we all just sugar coat everything and stay positive. My conversations have all seemed to stifle negative feelings about online school because talking negatively may just make us feel worse. That doesn't help me personally because I need to express my negative emotions in order to cope by talking it out with people who can relate, it's just how I deal with things, so the way that lots of the UCLA peers who I talk to are handling it makes it hard for me to cope.","My concerns are about how this pandemic will affect the social aspects of society. For example, I really love our downtowns and local thrift shops here in my city, but after this pandemic, I'm not sure if our smaller stores will have enough money to remain open. I have been hearing lots of people talking about how only restaurants and office buildings will be open in the future and how this could be the end of malls. Since this pandemic has forced us all to rely on technology and being serviced through technology, I'm concerned that even after the pandemic, this might wipe away actual stores now. I am also concerned about how so much screen time (whether for school or work or other recreational activities) will have affected my sleep quality, my eye muscles, depression levels, etc. after such a long quarantine during this pandemic.","This pandemic has really increased my anxiety about success in academics, at least at UCLA. UCLA is really not designed to be online, and I understand that this transition is so new and it happened so fast and our faculty and staff are doing the best they can, but it has taken a toll on me. Several factors have contributed to my anxiety. A few are that I am not as motivated to watch my pre-recorded lecture as if I was going to class, the professors are reading off of powerpoints, there is a lack of guided interactive work to make up for the lost in-person-lecture advantage, and consistent technology issues have made it difficult to follow along with any live discussions. All of these are huge hurdles that I have not been prepared for and that I am trying to navigate on my own because no one has had to go through this before really, so I can't really ask much advice from people. It has helped that UCLA is allowing us to take multiple pass/no-pass grading options, but I really prefer to have the opportunity to keep boosting my GPA, and these new hurdles make it hard to keep up with my performance from before this pandemic.","Zoom has both lowered and increased the effect of social distancing on my academic and social life. It has increased it because the technology issues are so frustrating, and having those frustrations every day and in every interaction made using technology has made me feel less connected and it severely dampens the excitement of finally having a way to connect. It has helped to lower the effect by, of course, being the only means of connecting with the outside world.","It actually hasn't really affected my philosophy of life or what I consider to be the most important. If anything, it has solidified my priorities and makes me more grateful that my upbringing has helped shape the priorities that I do have -- God, family, health, and happiness.","This has had some very cool positive affects. For example, I am now exploring hobbies that I have never had before and talents that I never knew I had, such as belly dancing, playing the piano and ukulele, sketching, watching documentaries, and renovating my mom's house. The way I have been engaging in all of these activities has allowed me to better my relationship with my mom, family, and friends as I share these talents with others and bring happiness to people who need it during this time."
