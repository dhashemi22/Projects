I have never been more miserable than when I was in a PIC course here at UCLA. I never got any programming experience prior to the course, and to come into the most introductory class and have a preset curve AND 40% of kids already have experience is just infuriating to be honest. I was lost the whole time, my professor was rude and unhelpful, my mental health declined as a result. The academic issues arise when people are experts in a domain already and take intro courses, AND when there are mandatory curves that the department adheres to, which is utterly ridiculous.

I didn't experience any academic issues per se, but I was one of the top students in my high school, and never really learned how to study effectively (let alone study at all). Homework and tests just got harder, and I couldn't keep up with them. I underestimated how much time I needed to put into my projects and didn't allocate enough time. I realized that procrastinating is very bad for the time consuming CS projects. Thus, the transition into college was difficult and my grades didn't fare too well. Additionally, the other students in my classes are really smart, so competing with them for grades is challenging. ","Being born in America, I haven't really experienced any cultural or social issues that might have made it challenging. This might sound really weird, but I actually think that because of the privileged situation I was born into, I became lazy. My parents, having immigrated to America, had to work very hard from a young age to help their families survive. I on the other hand, have been very blessed and placed in a financially stable family due to the hard work of my parents. In a sense, I'm spoiled and just never felt the urgency to work hard in school as the fear of not having money or food never isn't real to me. This laziness does actually contribute to my academic performance. It is obviously not proven that my upbringing is the reason why I am so aloof, but this is just my opinion.  Anyway, I feel many students procrastinate and such, but many still have a drive to do well and succeed that leads to action. Me on the other hand, would very much like to do better, but this desire isn't enough to push me to action. I'm okay with the C's that I get though I would like A's and B's. All of this plus poor time management skills plus all of the opportunities to socialize in college just add together to make studying difficult. ","I found a Christian fellowship on campus and the environment has been very welcoming from day one. All the people in the fellowship are extremely nice and have treated me like family. I am welcome in their homes, we study together, eat together, and just live life together. They have been a very influential part of who I am today.   ","I would say that high schools could prepare students better. Obviously, this is out of UCLA's control, and some schools don't have the resources to improve this. Everything I can think of lies in the student's themselves and not on the school, so this is very difficult. I think maybe encourage a mindset of learning rather than getting grades. It's very difficult when the world places so much value on the GPA, but I think this could help students develop a healthier mindset about school. Yeah, I can't think of much. Sorry. "

At the same time, I worried that whether the courses we taught here were easier than the courses students took in China.

My personal experience in UCLA STEM, mostly math classes with some physics and programming,  has been full of discouragement. If I don't get a subject, I feel dumb, but I have to remember that this is the first time I'm seeing this and it isn normal to not understand right away. Like with anything, it takes time and practice to become good at something, time that isn't available in a quarter system. Sometimes there are people who get things right away, and that makes it really difficult for the rest of us. Often I feel like if I had just a little more time I would be able to do much better in my classes. In STEM classes more than any other type of class, your entire grade is based on exams. No other assignments and barely any points for homework. This makes it very difficult for those who struggle with test taking. I have developed test taking anxiety just from attending UCLA. I have never gotten an A in a math class. Mostly B's and some C's. Which makes my STEM GPA very low compared to other majors at UCLA. It is unfortunate that many STEM students will undoubtedly have a lower GPA that north campus majors. ","The best STEM majors are often just focused on school. I prioritize my health, sleep, and well-being ahead of school most of the times. I have to be up very early for rowing team practices. Other people enjoy hanging out with friends and being social at night. It is very difficult to do this as a STEM major.","Professors can make a big difference on this sense of belonging. How they respond to different students, how willing they are to help and make adjustments, and what they expect all cater to different types of students. If a professor doesn't have time for the type of student you are, you feel behind and like you are not supposed to be here.","Many math classes are 3 days a week for 50 minutes. It is hard to digest anything in this time. I would prefer longer classes. More personable TA's. Consistent degrees of exam difficulty among professors (especially professors teaching the same course). BRUINCASTING LECTURES!! Only 1 of my math classes has been bruincasted. All of my north campus friends' lectures are bruincasted. Less emphasis on grades and more on learning. More evenly distributed grades- i.e. not having your entire grade based on 2 tests. Does not promote learning, just fear and cramming."

It became difficult to communicate with teachers and friends about my classes and how I was doing as I feared that they would judge me for the difficulties that I was having.","Joining a club at UCLA - mock trial - certainly helped. Opening up to friends about the difficulties that I was having and talking to teachers about improving my situation were very helpful to me. In general, having people to talk to increased my sense of belonging. ","The expectations of STEM classes are higher than in other classes. That increased difficulty can become wearing and isolating. Teacher's have to make sure that students don't become isolated and can continue to enjoy the learning, despite the difficulties inherent in the class. Organizing group work can assist with this, as long as group work is truly done collaboratively. Giving opportunities to make up work that was done poorly so that students don't become so stressed that their grade - and then their GPA and their futures - is going to permanently suffer could help to mitigate the wear. Otherwise, having a close relationship between teacher and student, as well among students, allows students to reach out when they are struggling. Explicit encouragement for students to reach out can be helpful as well. "

Coming to UCLA, I had to work multiple jobs, deal with a broken skull, and become accustomed to the fast pace environment. I quickly realized that everyone around me was either ""at my level"", or higher. I personally knew people who could call their parents and get academic advice (parents were doctors who received their degrees in the States), others asked for money transferred to their accounts whenever they pleased. Some had connections and were quickly accommodated in research labs/ were able to work in professional settings. It was difficult for me as I didn't have that financial freedom or family members who I could ask for advice. When my first grades weren't as high as I've always been accustomed to, I began to lose self-confidence and doubt myself. It's taken a toll on me because I have been working these past 3 years to build my confidence in myself back up again. What is most heartbreaking for me is that I pour everything I have into my studies and, more often than I'd like, the grades I receive do not reflect my work.

However, being a DACA student, there weren't really any potential job openings in that field for non-citizens. Coming here, I had to work at least 2 jobs, on top of being a full time student because I come from a low socio-economic background and my family was having financial difficulties. At one point, my stress/anxiety was so high, I had to resort to CAPS. Moreover, being a first generation student, the first in both my immediate and extended family to go to college, I didn't have anyone to rely on and had to figure it out on my own (resources/classes/lifestyle). I want to go into the Petroleum Engineering field, and as a first-generation, DACA, Hispanic female I feel that certain jobs like these prioritize males, especially white males.","Belonging: being a part of USP and mentoring through SWE.

For example, in my freshman year I had to take weekly quizzes for my Life Science course.  These quizzes comprised close to 5% of my grade and, objectively, were not a big deal.  However, I sometimes felt intensely anxious when taking them, especially if I thought I performed poorly.  This led to academic struggles in the class.  I felt negatively about my academic performance, even when my weighted grade was high, because these scores were usually lower.  Sometimes this made me not want to do assignments or go to class, but I made myself because I knew these also counted toward my grade.  This anxiety was mostly fueled by rumors about ""weed-out"" STEM classes, which curve down to lower grades.  It turns out that these rumors were mostly incorrect.   Even though the classes were difficult, I performed well and succeeded.","When I was a first-year student, I struggled with being away from home.  I am very close to my family, so living on-campus was a shock for me.  I often felt isolated and had a difficult time making friends.  I sometimes felt looked down upon because I was unsure of my major/career path.  Many of my peers seemed more organized in this sense and aspired to do great things in their life.  I often felt lonely and depressed.  I managed to find a small community for other students like me through the College Honors Program and my classes.  I made friends and pushed myself to make the most of the university.","Being part of a club made me feel like I belonged on campus.  My club visits elementary schools weekly to teach science.  I met some great people and felt that I was making a positive contribution to the community.  On the other hand, living on the Hill made me feel more isolated.  I had a difficult time connecting to people and making friends in such a large community.  I sometimes felt that I was the only person struggling socially, as many people I encountered were always positive and outgoing.","Some ways to improve STEM majors is to focus on holistic learning over ""weeding out"" students in the first year(s).  This would help students adjust and lower stress levels.  Additionally, you could create organizations and communities on-campus for students, including students who do not have definitive post-college plans.  It would be great if there were a general mailing list for STEM majors so we could learn about opportunities outside our individual major.  That way, we could explore the campus and meet different people who may share similar experiences with us."

Initially falling behind in a course starts a positive feedback loop of feeling inept, discouraged, and being afraid of asking basic questions for fear of wasting the professor/TA's time.","Knowing that I'm not alone in whatever I'm struggling with. If when speaking with other students (for example during TA section) I discover that they have similar questions and lack of understanding, I don't feel quite as isolated and incompetent.","Have professors/TAs encourage questions, regardless of complexity.

The further we students fall behind, the harder it is to recover as more and more materials are based on the earlier ones.","As a first-generation student from a low-income family, a lot of pressure is placed on me to obtain a high-paying career in the future, and admittedly, I am guided to believe that it is only achievable through a STEM major.

It's hard to keep up with the onslaught of information that can be thrown at you when learning about the natural sciences, mathematics, etc., especially in a quarter system.

I think what is significantly harder for STEM based classes is when you spend free time outside of lecture to read the textbook and do the readings before the lecture then show up only to be told relatively the exact same thing as what you already read in the lecture. Granted there is a given opportunity for clarification but at some points it feels like repetition.","Given my choice in majors it's hard at times to feel a sense of belonging as the fields are historically westernized and taught through a eurocentric lens, however the sense of belonging on campus comes from socialization of like minded individuals who have similar experiences to me or come from first generation families, it's these ties that make the campus feel a little less foreign.","1.

Also, classes were we really get to interact with the other students in the class.","I think helping reduce the culture that everyone in STEM is going to fail and they need to fight with their peers for a spot would help minimize all the stress associated with STEM. Also, just having smaller classes in general. Being in Moore with like 300 students, it's hard to make any connection with the class or professors. "

Mainly, it was difficult to stay motivated when my engineering courses put extreme strain on me and kept me wondering if I would even pass classes when I was already focused on giving my best effort.","As a STEM major, I ran into mental and social issues because I was spending too much time isolated with my work and I began losing the confidence that I could succeed academically as the difficulty increased. As a result, I sunk into what was my worst and least fun quarter at UCLA due to the isolation academics put on me.","Examples of me feeling a sense of belonging to UCLA's campus comes from the community that I feel with people in clubs, close friend-groups, classes, and just from walking and interacting with everyone. The other students here are all faced with a bunch of the same challenges and everyone is here for each other to support and be open about their own struggles.","There are a few effective steps UCLA could take to mitigate the challenges on STEM majors. The first is to fix the scheduling issues that force kids out of classes, or at least with administration being more upfront on planning scheduling for incoming students. My freshman year, I felt misled into taking classes at a rapid pace to avoid falling behind and felt like it was a crisis when I got locked out of half my classes, when really its a normal thing. In addition, I would advise STEM classes, especially for engineers, to stop having lower credit hour totals. Why would the 20 and 30 series physical chemistry have less credit hours than the 14 series biological chemistry when the physical chemistry series is seen as the more difficult one? I see elements of unit shaving for STEM majors so that their majors can be more dense but still not look outrageous when unit counts are compared."

The college of letters and science hosts a wide variety of majors, and to have the standards for top 1%, 2%, etc. be compared between STEM and non-STEM majors seems unjust, seeing as though many STEM majors receive lower grades due to increased competition and lower test scores due to a variety of other factors."
