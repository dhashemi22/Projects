2. They(stats dept) do not care about students enough, especially for those who are not stats major students. 

I had a horrible experience with stats advisors and they delayed my academic progress on stats minor for 2 quarters with both advisors' discrepancy and non-consistency with stats prerequisites classes. I heard many students had same experience of mine in terms of dealing their issues and questions in double or minor major with stats with advisors in stats dept. I even heard the manager of classes(I am not quite sure his title) said "" You'd better declare stats major ASAP, I don't want to see you again"" to a student which I think was pretty rude and discouraging. These words should not come from an educator or even a staff from a university. 

3. Maybe because UCLA has too many students that the class schedule is hard to accommodate all students. 

My sister is also a math and stats student graduating from UC Berkeley. Compared to her experience in UCB, I feel like UCB's registration system is more advanced than ours and UCB provides more flexibility to students to choose classes with their flexible prerequisite class requirement and cross-department classes enrollment. As long as you think you could handle it and the professor is willing to add you into the class, it's no problem to attend higher sequence classes regardless the prerequisite requirement or if it is cross-department/cross-major class which makes students have as many as possibilities to explore and succeed in their college life. 
I don't think UCLA cares about this, the staff just cares about killing the line outside their office and wants you to leave the office with no concern of whether your problem has been solved. 
To further illustrate, I would like to put my case as an example here, I took a stats10 in my community college which UCLA stats dept did not recognize it as equivalent to stats10 here and advisor A here insisted that I have to retake stat10 before taking stat20(where advisor B just manually enrolled my friend who had same situation as mine to a stat20 class, I knew this after the enrolling deadline, if not, I could have just gone to advisor B to have me added to stat20), but when I retook a stat10 here in UCLA, the registrar counted as a repetitive class so gave me zero credits of it. 
The problem exists for years without fixing and the consequence falls on students themselves including me. Because of this, I could not enroll into stat20 in 2018 fall which I should have been able to. In the later winter quarter I found out my stat10 enrollment had no credits so I dropped it with no stat20 provided in that quarter. Even then I went to stats dept, the advisor still did not care and asked me to come back next quarter when stat20 is available. In spring, I went back and the manager of classes did not solve the problem and asked me to consult with registrar why the registrar did not give credits for my stat10 here.  The staff in registrar thought it was wired that they could not do anything to a junior(at that time I was a junior) a repetitive class credits and for stats dept it was an small issue that they could just manually got around this issue and add me to stat20.  
Rather than a call to figure out this problem or even have a meeting to seriously discuss about this issue that many transfer students might have, they just let me went back and forth from the stats dept and Murphy Hall with both parties throwing their ball to the other. This was a very long story and here is just a small piece of it. After this, I felt exhausted and frustrated and do not want to make any contact with any admin staff here in UCLA. 
I have told this story to my sister who had same situation as mine that in her junior year she also needed to work with their stats dept on classes enrollment and double major declaration stuff, she never encountered any unhappiness with their dept over there in UCB and she thought it was unbelievable that our system was so rigid and inflexible because the only way for me to enroll stat20 is to 'beg' the stats dept staff to add me in as our system prevented me from enrolling higher sequence of classes which in UCB system, they won't prevent you from enrolling classes unless you acknowledge that you have full responsibility for your own academic progress and path.

I would have changed my major if it weren't for people listening to me and telling me it'll get better, offering the help they can give help me academically and emotionally. For instance, I once went to the Director of The Curtis Center, Heather Dallas, and told her about my situation and not meeting the requirements for my major. She listened to me and told me about her struggles, then contacted one of her students to help me in my last pre-requisite course so that I can get the necessary grade to get into my major. Moreover, I had a co-worker that I told my situation to and how I felt like I was depressed, so she accompanied me to CAPS so I can talk to someone. I had other friends that just listened when I was having a breakdown, and even just having someone listen to me was helpful. ","One of the factors is the environment in my classes, where I feel alone because most of the students are white or asian, and appear to understand lectures way more than me. This would make me doubt myself and block my motivation. I always compared myself to others, so when I would get a low score on an exam, I felt like I didn't belong.

For example, I had some health issues last year and one of my friends approached me and said she'd been dealing with similar issues. The issues were affecting me both academically and emotionally, and her support really helped me get through it. 

I've also become very involved with UCLA Hillel and Jewish life on campus. Through this community, I've made so many friendships and connections that I know I will have for the rest of my life. I've grown as a student, a friend and a leader, and I can say with confidence that I wouldn't be doing as well as I am here if it weren't for this incredible community. ","As a STEM major, I sometimes feel that I'm not getting as much support from my professors and TA's as I deserve.  For example, I had a math professor for Linear Algebra who, in many ways, discouraged us from asking questions. When we did ask questions, he often provided a quick one word answer and didn't fully explain his thoughts. This experience made it harder for me to succeed in this class both because it decreased my confidence and because it made it harder for me to receive guidance and feedback. 

Though I've had several STEM professors who are very good, I am aware that STEM professors tend to exhibit this type of behavior more than non-STEM professors. I'm not exactly sure how UCLA could address this issue, but I think it is important for students of all majors to receive the support they deserve.

I felt a lot happier since I don't worry about my GPA as much anymore, but I still feel like I can't learn just for the fun of it because there's always the pressure of getting a good grade in class.

The support of my parents has helped succeed in every way possible at UCLA. I have parents who support my mental health and my education. I am fortunate enough that they can also pay my full college tuition. They are a huge factor in my success here. 

Personal motivation has also been an important factor for success at UCLA. It is such a large campus community that it is easy to just feel like a number, sort of unimportant. One of the biggest things I learned was the need to self-advocate, to speak up for help and opportunities, and to actively participate in groups on campus. This has helped me feel like I belong at UCLA. ","Something specific that I feel has inhibited the success I wanted to have at UCLA has been trying to find undergraduate research experiences in the sciences. As a freshman, I applied to the biomedical research minor after earning an A+ in the preparatory course. I had a 3.9 GPA at the time. I was interviewed but was rejected. I applied twice more after this, and was still rejected. When I asked what could be done to improve my application, I was given generic answers. There was not really a clear explanation for my not getting accepted, despite limited lab space. After this, I struggled to find independent research opportunities with other professors. I tried cold emailing, and talking with professors in office hours. At one point in my junior year, I spoke to a professor about his lab and he said that he would rather accept freshmen because they have more years to spend in the lab, which would make training them worth it. I explained that I had wanted to start research as a freshmen but had struggled to find opportunities. I developed a great relationship with a professor who was not actively doing research, but who recommended me to several of his colleagues, but I was still not able to find an opportunity. I am now in my fourth year. I am disappointed, because I chose UCLA partly because of its reputation for incredible research. I even reached out to the chair of my major department, asking for feedback or advice on finding lab research opportunities, but was not told any information I did not already know or had not already tried. I just feel there was never an answer as to why I was not accepted into the minor, and since then, the challenge of finding a research opportunity has taken a toll on me.

During more challenging and depressive mental periods, I used the CAPS resource center, which helped a bit as well. ","I felt like it was difficult to get involved when I first transferred in. Many organizations are very competitive, and as a result, I feel that many students can struggle to find a place they belong, or acquire access to some of the campuses best resources.  The answer to this problem was to just keep applying, but even then, a student can lose access to valuable resources some clubs tend to have. I think this furthers the notion that a student at a public university is on his/her own, and a result, fostering a more competitive environment. 

Academically, I was always frustrated with discussion and office hours. While some professors/classes put a great emphasis on helping their students, other classes have hundreds of students waiting 20 minutes to ask a professor or TA a question.

When I started at UCLA, I felt an immense pressure like never before to prove to my peers that I’d earned my spot alongside them. As cynical as it may sound to say so, I found that talking to others in class often left me feeling drained and inferior. Pressure for success and perfection is applied as heavily by classmates as parents, professors, and institutions. It’s my third year and I’m only barely feeling as though I have my head above water, and this is only after I’ve made the decision to live off-campus. Distance is what helped me succeed at UCLA; I found that the distractions on campus— whether they took the form of chaotic roommates or unrelentingly perfect classmates— were too much for my mental health. Moving off-campus, into a quiet neighborhood with my partner, has proven invaluable to my ability to succeed academically at UCLA. However, I’ve undoubtedly had to sacrifice my social life as a result of this distance— I’m no longer close (spatially) to my friends, which makes it nearly impossible to ever see each other since we’re all so busy with the demands of school and extracurriculars. 

Ultimately, a bit of separation from campus culture is what I needed to succeed. Academia, especially STEM at UCLA, invites a toxic culture of achievement, comparison, and perfection, that is tangible to all students— but we ignore it, even choosing to participate if it’ll give us an advantage. I need as much distance from that as is reasonably possible. ","I failed my first Chem quiz at UCLA. It was the very first quiz I ever took in college, and I got a 50%. I’d never received a score so low on anything, and I was crushed, turning to my floormates and classmates to complain— and hopefully seek encouragement. I was met with almost satisfied suggestions to drop the course, to change majors, to change life paths. “This is going to be really, really difficult for you if you don’t even understand THAT.” “Are you sure you want to be pre-med?” “You know Chem’s only going to get harder.” Each person I spoke to smiled quietly at my (literal) failure, urging me to give up, convincing me that each test carried the weight of my entire future. I assumed I just had bad luck with floormates, so I started a group chat with a few classmates from my Chem class. One person texted and asked a basic conceptual question, to which another member replied “I can’t answer that. My parents read my messages and will be upset with me if they see I’m helping the competition.” 

At this point, only a few weeks into my freshman year, the toxic culture of UCLA pre-meds was entirely tangible— in fact, it had slapped me in the face. I was dejected. I felt like every person around me saw me as competition, rather than a classmate or peer that they could learn from (and vice versa). The environment that has been cultivated at UCLA, specifically in the STEM department, is absolutely crushing— and no one’s allowed to acknowledge that. If you acknowledge that this is hard, then you’ve lost. It often feels as though the expectation at UCLA is to be perfect, to never fail, to never blink an eye at the overwhelming expectations of classes and extracurriculars— because we’re Bruins, we’re the #1 public university. 

As someone with mental health issues, I’ve often found it detrimental to rise to the occasion. In order to do all that is expected of me, I have to sacrifice my social life, my personality, sleep, eating— school has to be my #1 priority at all times. Lack of routine, especially sleep and meal times, has destabilized my mental health every single quarter. I’m exhausted, and I can’t turn to my peers, because we’re all just supposed to pretend we’re doing fine. The intersection of the toxicity of campus culture and my own personal mental health issues often leaves me feeling at a disadvantage compared to other students (especially when you account for the lack of availability of sufficient psychological and psychiatric care from the University).",High Value,18.8,16.7,69.4,50,66.7,57.5,60.7142857142857,low,3,3,4,2,2

When I got on the bus to go back to my apartment, a man sat next to me and asked me questions on where I lived. He tried to lean his head on my shoulder and it made me very uncomfortable.

-my high school. I feel like my high school did a really good job preparing me for the rigor and workload at UCLA.
-supportive family. My family is always glad to hear from me when I call home and I enjoy my conversations with them.
-supportive mentors. They're not official mentors, but older people throughout my time here at UCLA have helped me through difficult emotional and social moments in my life. They've also really encouraged me to try things I would have never been brave enough to try. I've had a lot of cool experiences because of some of these people. 
-interesting classes. I've really enjoyed some of my classes because I've opportunities to explore some of my very niche interests. 
-cultural nights. They've really inspired me to embrace my Asian American identity more. I'm more interested in learning about what it means to be Asian-American and fully appreciate my culture. ","-my stress/anxiety when it comes to exams and academics. I feel like I don't have a healthy coping mechanism and that I'm worrying and abnormal amount. I've been told that I stress so much that I start to stress other people around me (who don't usually get stressed). 
-lack of emotional understanding. I don't think I understand my emotions very well and how to process them. Therefore, I think I can run myself into the ground sometimes without noticing. Or I feel like my exhaustion and stress are normal. 
-imposter syndrome. Everyone here seems to be doing a lot. UCLA definitely feels very competitive. 
-dissatisfaction with myself. I have trouble feeling content with myself in every aspect. I have trouble recognizing my achievements. I struggle with body image. I feel like I can't compete with others. I'm always comparing myself to others.
-don't understand my mental health. I've never seen a therapist, though I feel like it might help. I don't know how mentally healthy I am.
